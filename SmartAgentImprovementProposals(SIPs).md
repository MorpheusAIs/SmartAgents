## SmartAgent Improvement Proposal or "SIP 0" 

The Smart Agenet Improvement Proposals (SIPs) start with an open review process, includes testings, and finally inclusion in a production version of the Smart Agents reference implimentation. 

All SIPs should define a specific prompt and the code connected to it and included in the "internal" code of the downloadable Smart Agent binary install package. They should generally extend the capabilities of the Smart Agent Software for example by adding specific Prompts for the Smart Agent to recognize when the user requests them.

The SIP should specify how to map this new prompt to cryptographically validated external Smart Contracts or APIs.
