Prompt Rank Algorithm

Definition: The Prompt Rank algorithm creates a graph of the relationships between prompts from users & Smart Contracts. The output is a ranked list of Smart Contracts that a Smart Agent can interact with based on the user’s choice. By tallying the number of Smart Contracts conducting transactions with other Smart Contracts this generates a first “usage score” for all Smart Contracts. Then you run the algorithm again and calculate the “weighted score” based on the score of each Smart Contract added to the total number of transactions of all their connected Smart Contracts.

Example:
Step #1: Tallies Transactions Between Smart Contacts To Generate A “Usage Score”
Contract A = Has 1 transaction with each B + C = 2 Transactions
Contract B = Has 1 transaction with each A + C + D = 3 Transactions
Contract C = Has 1 transaction with each A + B + D + F = 4 Transactions
Contract D = Has 1 transaction with each A + B + E = 3 Transactions
Contract E = Has 1 transaction with each A + B + C + D + E = 5 Transactions

Step #2: Add Usage Scores Together To Generate A “Weighted Score” Dataset
Contract A = 3 + 4 = 7 Transactions  
Contract B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 Transactions 
Contract C = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 Transactions
Contract D = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 Transactions

Step #3: Specific Keywords Related To The Prompt Generate A List Via KeyWeb3LLM
KeywordLLM enhancement dataset added to the Smart Agent Protocol which was trained on Web3 datasets of all smart contracts & blockchains. Result: 
Contracts A, B, C, & D are related to the user Prompt.

Step #4: KeyWeb3LLM list is ranked by the Weighted Scores = Prompt Rank Output:
Rank #1 Smart Contact D = 10
Rank #2 Smart Contract B = 9 
Rank #3 Smart Contract C = 8
Rank #4 Smart Contract A = 7
 
Tools For Building Prompt Rank:
The Graph protocol can be used to query data from both Layer 1’s and Smart Contracts. Create A Graph of Smart Contracts to Prompt Keywords & Phrases. Existing database of Smart Contracts. Person types in a Prompt at ChatWe3.org’s website. They are presented with a list of Smart Contracts that do what they requested. If the Smart Contract offers a referral fee / donation mechanism, then use those fees to cover the gas costs for the user seamlessly, and pay out the remainder as a donation to the Smart Agent community. PromptRank.org website for devs to call the API running the prompt rank database. Of course user selection and Smart Agent transactions can add weight to the Smart Contract scores over time.
